Here is the updated **README** without the actual configurations but still detailing the network and its setup:

# **MPLS QoS and BGP Configuration with VRF Setup**

## **Overview**

This document describes the configuration of a network consisting of **4 routers** (R1, R2, R3, and R4). The network utilizes **MPLS**, **QoS**, and **BGP** with **VRF** for traffic separation and optimal routing. The configuration assumes that **R4** is a **customer router** connected to **R1** and communicates with **R3** through **VRF1**.

## **Network Topology**

```
       [R1] 
      /    \
   e0/0    e0/1
 10.0.12.1 10.0.13.1
  /           \
[R2]---------[R3]
  \           /
  e0/1      e0/0
10.0.23.1  10.0.23.2
  |
  |
[R4]  <- Customer Router
  |
  |  e0/0   192.168.4.1/24  ->  R1 e0/2
```

- **R1**: Core Router, connects to **R2**, **R3**, and **R4**.
- **R2** and **R3**: Intermediary routers connecting **R1** with **R4**.
- **R4**: Customer router connected to **R1** via **VRF1**.

## **Steps for Configuration**

### **1. R1 Configuration**
R1 is the core router that connects to **R2**, **R3**, and **R4**. It has **MPLS**, **iBGP**, and **QoS** configured. Here's a summary of the configuration:

- **MPLS** enabled on the interfaces.
- **BGP** iBGP sessions with **R2**, **R3**, and **R4**.
- **QoS Policy** with **Class-1** (high priority) and **Class-2** (lower priority) applied on **Ethernet0/0** and **Ethernet0/1**.

### **2. R2 Configuration**
R2 is the intermediary router that connects **R1** to **R3** and plays a role in **iBGP** and **MPLS** forwarding. Here's the configuration:

- **BGP** iBGP session between **R1** and **R3**.
- **MPLS** configured to forward traffic.

**Key Points:**
- **Ethernet0/0** on **R2** connects to **R1** (IP 10.0.12.2).
- **Ethernet0/1** connects to **R3** (IP 10.0.23.2).
- **MPLS** enabled.

### **3. R3 Configuration**
R3 is another intermediary router, responsible for connecting **R2** and **R4** (via **VRF1**) and implementing **MPLS**.

**Key Points:**
- **Ethernet0/1** on **R3** connects to **R2** (IP 10.0.23.1).
- **Ethernet0/0** connects to **R4** (IP 192.168.4.2).
- **BGP** iBGP session between **R1** and **R3**.

### **4. R4 Configuration (Customer Router)**
R4 is the customer router connected to **R1** through **Ethernet0/0**. The **VRF1** configuration allows **R4** to be separated into its own routing context. The **BGP** session with **R1** ensures that **R4** can communicate with the **MPLS** network.

**Key Points:**
- **Ethernet0/0** on **R4** is configured for **VRF1** with the IP address **192.168.4.1/24**.
- **BGP** session with **R1** at **192.168.4.2**.
- **QoS** policies applied on **Ethernet0/0** for traffic prioritization.

## **Configuration Files**

The configurations for **R1**, **R2**, **R3**, and **R4** are as follows:

- **R1**: Core router with MPLS, BGP, and QoS configurations.
- **R2**: Intermediary router between **R1** and **R3**.
- **R3**: Another intermediary router, connecting **R2** to **R4** via **VRF1**.
- **R4**: Customer router with **VRF** configuration and **QoS** policies applied.

---

## **Testing Connectivity**

1. **Ping Test**:
   - From **R4** to **R3**: 
     ```bash
     ping vrf VRF1 192.168.4.2
     ```
   - Ensure that the routing tables and BGP sessions are correctly established for proper forwarding.

2. **Verify BGP and MPLS**:
   - Use `show ip bgp summary` and `show mpls forwarding-table` on the routers to check BGP sessions and MPLS labels.

3. **Verify QoS**:
   - Use `show policy-map interface Ethernet0/0` on **R4** to check the **QoS policy** applied to the interface.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

- **BGP Not Establishing?**
  - Verify that **R4** and **R1** have the correct neighbor configuration.
  - Ensure that the IP addresses on interfaces are correct and that **MPLS** is enabled on the interfaces.
  - Check if there are any **ACLs** or **firewall settings** blocking BGP.

- **QoS Not Working?**
  - Check if the correct **preference values** are being set for **Class-1** and **Class-2**.
  - Ensure the **QoS policy** is applied to the correct interfaces.

## **Conclusion**

This README outlines the steps to configure **MPLS**, **iBGP**, **QoS**, and **VRF** on the routers in this network. It ensures proper isolation of customer traffic, optimal routing with BGP, and traffic engineering using **MPLS**. It also implements **QoS** for prioritizing traffic flows.

The MPLS forwarding table you've provided is a typical table used in MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) networks to determine how packets are forwarded based on labels. Let’s break down each column and row to explain what each part means:

### Columns in the MPLS Forwarding Table:

1. **Local Label**: This is the MPLS label assigned to the packet at the ingress (entry) point of the MPLS network. This label will be used by the MPLS routers to forward packets.

2. **Outgoing Label or Tunnel Id**: This is the label that will be used when the packet is forwarded out of the MPLS network. The router will pop the local label from the packet and may push a new outgoing label (if applicable) or pass the packet without a label if it's going to be forwarded in a non-MPLS network.

3. **Prefix**: This is the IP address or network prefix that is being forwarded. This is the destination address or range for which the label forwarding entry applies.

4. **Bytes Switched**: This column shows the amount of data (in bytes) that has been forwarded or switched for that particular entry in the MPLS forwarding table.

5. **Outgoing Interface**: This is the physical or logical interface where the packet will be forwarded out of the router.

6. **Next Hop**: This is the next router or hop in the network that the packet will be sent to.

### Row-by-Row Breakdown:

1. **First Row**:
   - **Local Label**: 17
   - **Outgoing Label**: Pop Label (this means the label is removed and not replaced, essentially the packet is forwarded without an MPLS label).
   - **Prefix**: 10.0.12.0/30[V] (This means the destination IP range is 10.0.12.0 to 10.0.12.3).
   - **Bytes Switched**: 0 (No bytes have been switched yet).
   - **Outgoing Interface**: `aggregate/VRF1` (This means the packet will be sent out through the `aggregate` interface in the VRF1 (Virtual Routing and Forwarding) instance).
   - **Next Hop**: The next hop is not specified in this row, but it's implied that it will be forwarded to the next router in the path that handles this prefix.

2. **Second Row**:
   - **Local Label**: 18
   - **Outgoing Label**: Pop Label (again, the label is removed).
   - **Prefix**: 10.0.13.0/30[V] (This indicates the destination IP range is 10.0.13.0 to 10.0.13.3).
   - **Bytes Switched**: 0 (No bytes have been switched yet).
   - **Outgoing Interface**: `aggregate/VRF1` (The packet will be sent out through the same interface as the first row, `aggregate` in the `VRF1` instance).
   - **Next Hop**: Again, not specified, but the packet will be sent to the next router handling this prefix.

3. **Third Row**:
   - **Local Label**: 19
   - **Outgoing Label**: Pop Label (The label is removed).
   - **Prefix**: 192.168.4.0/24[V] (This indicates the destination IP range is 192.168.4.0 to 192.168.4.255).
   - **Bytes Switched**: 0 (No bytes have been switched yet).
   - **Outgoing Interface**: `aggregate/VRF1` (This is the same as the previous rows).
   - **Next Hop**: This entry does not show a specific next hop, but it indicates that the packet will be forwarded to the next router responsible for this range.

### Key Points:
- **Pop Label**: This means that the router will remove the MPLS label from the packet as it forwards it. The label is typically popped when the packet is leaving the MPLS network or is entering a destination that doesn’t require MPLS anymore.
- **VRF1**: This is a Virtual Routing and Forwarding instance, which allows for multiple routing tables on the same router, providing isolation between different sets of routes (essentially supporting multiple virtual routers).

In summary, this table shows that packets destined for specific IP prefixes (10.0.12.0/30, 10.0.13.0/30, and 192.168.4.0/24) will have their MPLS labels removed and forwarded through the `aggregate` interface in the `VRF1` instance. The next hop isn’t explicitly listed but is assumed to be the next router in the path.
